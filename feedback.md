# iExec Tools Feedback

## What worked well
- iApp Generator CLI made scaffolding easy
- Local testing with `iapp test` was straightforward
- Deployment to Arbitrum Sepolia was smooth

## Challenges encountered  
- Understanding the iExec task lifecycle took time
- Setting up the callback from iApp to contract was complex
- Documentation for Arbitrum Sepolia addresses was hard to find

## Suggestions for improvement
- Provide a complete example of iApp → contract callback
- List all testnet addresses (router, token, etc.) in one place
- Add more templates for financial use cases like RWA
